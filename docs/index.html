        Hydrogen is an operating system targeted for x86, amd64 and ARM architectures. Currently, it only supports x86, but amd64 and ARM will follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has GDT, IDT, and uses serial instead of VGA text output. Because the main target is embedded computers and servers, support for VGA is not a main focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memory management, paging and scheduling are the main focus for now. Network drivers, disk drivers and FS drivers are a second priority. Then there is other shiny stuff, like VGA, graphics acceleration (will most likely use AMD)
        and USB support (which probably wont be supported)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a chipset/hardware manufacturer, and can provide datasheets (for networking ICs, graphics, USB chipsets, etc.), please, contact me.
